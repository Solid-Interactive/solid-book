# Project Setup

This chapter describes a typical project setup. From deployment strategies, to
code organization. Many of the concepts covered will apply to any project, but
we will be using a website running with Mongo, Node, and Nginx as the example.
We'll assume the code is version controlled with git 2.3+. We'll also cover some
PHP Fpm concepts.
