# Foreign Keys

tags: mysql, foreign keys, references

[Foreign keys](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/create-table-foreign-keys.html) allow you to make references from
one entry in a row in a table to another.

When a row containing a reference is deleted or updated you can have the child rows deleted or updated too using `CASCADE`.
