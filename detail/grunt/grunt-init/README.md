# Grunt-init

Initially we used grunt for all of our scaffolding, build, and deploy needs. Now
we tend to use grunt for tasks that involve configuration files or scaffolding.
For dev our day to day dev workflow we tend to use Gulp, since it is much faster.
This has the nice side effect of separating the files needed for dev workflow
from the files needed for builds, deploy, and scaffolding.
