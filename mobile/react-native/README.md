## React native community
* Many of the react native core components have been extracted into individual repos hosted in the react native community group.
* Use the community component instead of the core component, unless otherwise specified.
* See list here for repos and activity state: https://github.com/react-native-community/.github/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md

## Images
* Include base, 2x, and 3x sizes for devices with different screen densities, then require as image source. See full example here: https://reactnative.dev/docs/images

## Debug
* On the simulator, press `command + D`, then click Debug. This will open debugger in chrome devtools and you can look at console logs.
